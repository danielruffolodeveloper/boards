# Bords Full Stack Application

## Summary Of Project

Boards is a versatile, full-stack Kanban web application. Our goal is to create an awesome Kanban experience using modern web and cloud technologies.

We're implementing microservices and microfrontend architecture to keep things modular and user-friendly. Additionally, we're adopting a serverless approach on the Azure Platform when it adds value. All technologies used will be mostly from the Azure free tier ,https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-services

Our focus is on writing top-notch code rather than piling up features. Quality over quantity is our mantra. Let's build something fantastic and easy to maintain! ðŸš€

## V1.0.0

Version 1 of this project is essentially an MVP, with a primary focus on delivering only the essential features.
